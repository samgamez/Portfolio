                Image of a logo. There no visible differences between the three different images. There was also a negligible difference
                between the size of the images files.

                Detailed image of the human eye. Overall the images looked very similar. They had the same quality and image size.
                The size of the files were different. The PNG was the largest and the GIF was the second largest in terms of file size.

                Design animation. When converting from a GIF to a JPEG and PNG, it looks like the a
                copy of each frame in the animated gif was created. The images seen above are just one of 120 images for each format.

                Flower image. There is a noticeable difference in quality between the three images. The PNG
                was the highest quality while the JPEG was the lowest. The JPG image has no transparency so the 
                background shows as white instead of the blue background color.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                PNG images are generally used for images with a higher quality but they also have a much larger file size. 
                PNG images are usually larger in file size than JPEG images but they also have a slightly higher level of
                quality. JPEG images are used for lower quality images because the files are compressed in a way that cause 
                the image to lose quality to achieve a smaller file size. Finally, GIF images are used to add animation to 
                images. When converting from GIF to JPEG or PNG there were over a hundred image files that were downloaded 
                as a result. It looks like the GIF image is broken down into each frame used to create the animated image.
