            <h2>What is the difference between TCP/IP and HTTP?</h2>
            <p>
                TCP/IP is the name for the general protocol of transferring files from one computer to another.
                TCP/IP uses other protocols such as HTTP to transfer files across the web. This allows computers to communicate with each
                other across the web via HTTP requests.

            <h2>Define the term: URL.</h2>
            <p>
                URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It defines the location of a file on the world wide web. A URL is indicates the
                location of a file on a server that is connected to the internet.

                <h2>What is the client/server model?</h2>
                <p>
                    The client/server model is made up of a client computer and a server computer. The client is the computer that makes requests
                    to the server which then sends the appropriate response to the client. For example, when a computer accesses a URL on 
                    the internet, it sends a request to a server which will return a response with files that are used to display the web page.
