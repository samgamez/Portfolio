            <h2>My life</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Sam Gamez. I was born in New Jersey but I have lived in Utah for most of my life. I'm the
                oldest of three boys. After having me and my middle brother, my mother and father moved to try and find
                a place to settle. My mother was raised in Ogden, Utah and she still has family there so they eventually ended 
                up moving us back there.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a member of the LDS church and have a very firm belief in it. I served a mission in Eugene, Oregon which made up
                the best two years of my life at the time. I loved the people that I met in Oregon and will never forget some of the experiences
                that I had there.

            <h2>Family</h2>
            <p>
                After returning home from my mission, I started working as a custodian on Temple Square in Salt Lake City. It was
                there that I met the woman who would later become my wife, Sally Butterworth. Sally was also working as a custodian
                in the same building that I was and we became fast friends. After dating for 6 months I proposed to her and we were married
                on New Year's Eve that same year.
            </p>
            <p>
                We lived in Bountiful, Utah for a little while and while there we had two children. We had our son first. His name is Nicholas
                Eli Gamez and he is now three years old. We also had a daughter whom we named Anna Christine Gamez and she is one. After having
                our two kids we needed to find a bigger home than our apartment so we eventually bought a house in Clearfield which is where we
                live as a family together now.

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                I love to play games. Video games, board games, card games, I like it all. I like to play video games such as Star Wars:
                Battlefront 2 and The Legend of Zelda. For other types of games, I have a lot of fun with Clue and Dominion. I also love
                to read books. I really like fantasy and murder mysteries.  Now that I have a family and other responsibilities it can be 
                hard to find time for my own hobbies.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love to do things with my family now. My wife and I have set aside time each week to go out on a date. We love going out
                to movies for date night. We love to see Star Wars and movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. On other date nights we like
                stay in and read a book together.

            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>
                After I got home from my mission I started going to college at LDS Business College from where I graduated with an associate's
                degree in computer science. From there, I transferred to the University of Utah to start working towards a bachelor's. Just 
                before starting there, I found a job as a beginner programmer with the Davis School District which led us to move up to Clearfield
                because it was closer to the office that I work.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've been working there for a year now and in that time I've transferred to Weber State University where I plan on finishing my
                bachelor's degree. I feel that I've picked the right subject for my career. I love my job as a software developer and I feel like
                I'm going to be able to keep doing this for a long time. It's a pretty busy time in my life right now because I'm trying to work
                full-time as well as take classes as a full-time student. It will be worth it once I graduate from Weber State University.
