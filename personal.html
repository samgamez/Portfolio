                            My name is Sam Gamez. I was born in New Jersey but I have lived in Utah for most of my life. I'm the oldest of three boys.
                            After having me and my middle brother, my mother and father moved to try and find a place to
                            settle. My mother was raised in Ogden, Utah and she still has family there so they eventually
                            ended up moving us back there.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am a member of the LDS church and have a very firm belief in it. I served a mission in Eugene, Oregon which made up the
                            best two years of my life at the time. I loved the people that I met in Oregon and will never
                            forget some of the experiences that I had there.

                            After returning home from my mission, I started working as a custodian on Temple Square in Salt Lake City. It was there that
                            I met the woman who would later become my wife, Sally Butterworth. Sally was also working as
                            a custodian in the same building that I was and we became fast friends. After dating for 6 months
                            I proposed to her and we were married on New Year's Eve that same year.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We lived in Bountiful, Utah for a little while and while there we had two children. We had our son first. His name is Nicholas
                            Eli Gamez and he is now three years old. We also had a daughter whom we named Anna Christine
                            Gamez and she is one. After having our two kids we needed to find a bigger home than our apartment
                            so we eventually bought a house in Clearfield which is where we live as a family together now.

                            I love to play games. Video games, board games, card games, I like it all. I like to play video games such as Star Wars:
                            Battlefront 2 and The Legend of Zelda. For other types of games, I have a lot of fun with Clue
                            and Dominion. I also love to read books. I really like fantasy and murder mysteries. Now that
                            I have a family and other responsibilities it can be hard to find time for my own hobbies.

                            I love to do things with my family now. My wife and I have set aside time each week to go out on a date. We love going out
                            to movies for date night. We love to see Star Wars and movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
                            On other date nights we like stay in and read a book together.
