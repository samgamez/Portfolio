                    Samuel Gamez is a Software Developer who works with the Davis School District to create and maintain the websites, forms,
                    and programs used by the School District. Samuel knows that the digital world is constantly growing larger
                    and more complex with each passing day. He believes that the programs and websites he creates will help
                    others to easily navigate through this digital world while allowing them to do what they do best in their
                    chosen fields. Before working for the Davis School District, Samuel devoted his time to helping his fellow
                    students gain basic programming skills as a tutor and teacher's assistant. He has also helped write a
                    program for the Computer Science department at LDS Business College to help with grading specific assignments
                    so that the teachers can focus more time on assisting the students. Samuel has an Associate's Degree
                    in Computer Science from LDS Business College and is currently working towards his Bachelor's Degree
                    in Computer Science at Weber State University. In addition to being a Software Developer, Samuel loves
                    to spend time with his wife and two children. Whether it is trips to the park or playing Peek-a-Boo,
                    he is determined to see his family smile and hear them laugh. Samuel currently resides in Clearfield,
                    UT.
